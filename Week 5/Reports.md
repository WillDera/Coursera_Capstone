## <b>Reports</b>
<b>Based on the clustering model, we settled that, </b>

- The second and third clusters are heavily populated with Italian Restaurants which are in places like <b>Central Bay Street, Roncesvalles, Riverdale, Christie, Harbord, Runnymede(Swansea), Cabbagetown, Toronto Dominion Center, Commerce Court(Victoria Hotel), Toronto Islands, and Garden District(Ryerson)</b> to name a few.
    
- So standing on the fact that there is a heated competition going on in the above mentioned places, I would advice the Italian Chef to look at places like:
   - Kensington Market, Chinatown, and
   - First Canada Place, UnderGround City to target a higher population and if the food is good and the restaurant offer good customer service, it would cause the restaurant to grow rapidly
   
- Other alternatives are:
   - North Toronto West,
   - Davisville North, and
   - Yorkville
   
- Adelaide has a Latin Restaurant, choosing a location around or in this region can sprout a dangerous rivalry that if not sturdy enough might wreck the new restaurant that the Italian Chef wants to start up there in a short time.
